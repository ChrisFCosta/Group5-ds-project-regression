## Your task

Your task is to use RDD to estimate the effect of the following events in Quebec:

1. The 20/3/2020 lockdown
2. The reopening of schools on 31/8/2020
3. The 25/12/2020 lockdown

### Requirements

You need to find data on at least one COVID measure for `y` (either COVID cases, hospitalizations or deaths) and provide the following for each:

- A RDD plot similar to the ones shown above
- An interpretation of the p-value on the effect of the measure taken (the cutoff parameter)
- A justification on the design of your regression:

  - The amount of time included on both sides of the cutoff (longer is not necessarily better)
  - The polynomial degree (higher is not always better)
  - Other regression design considerations

- A 2 paragraph explanation of your findings for that event.
